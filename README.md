# Data Structures and Algorithms


### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `javascript` folder, at the top level, is a sub-folder called `code-challenges`

Each day, you'll add one new file to this folder to do your work for the day's assigned code challenge

If you have not already done so, run `npm install` from within this folder to setup your system to be able to run tests using `Jest`

To run your tests

- Change to the `javascript` folder
- run `npm test` to run all of the tests
- run `npm test ##` to only run tests for challenge ## (i.e. 01)
